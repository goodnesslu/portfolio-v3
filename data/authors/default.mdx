No one loves a showoff, but I do üòé. I love to see the best in people. I love to see the best in the world, and I love to see the best in myself.

And deep down I know you do to! Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this section of my website in the first place. So I promise, this is the last place on this website you'll see me showing off. Worry not...I don't have a lot to brag about ü•≤

## What are you currently doing and how did you get here?

I am currently working as a brand & marketing strategist with a focus on **building high converting client acqusition systems** üéØ. My background in brand strategy, visual design, and software development informs my unique & mindful but competitive approach to client aqcusition.

I have always had the goal of building products that offer solutions to millions of people. And that is what got me into software development. I learnt how to develop software with a problem-first lean approach. Over-time, I realized that people were not just going to come to your website to buy your product, but to use it to solve their problems.

But how could they come if you had no system to prodictably grab their attention? That is when I started to learn about the world of advertising. Hundreds of campaigns forward, I am still a student to the ever changing consumer landscape. Learning daily the latest trends and sharing his learnings here for the whole world to see ü§ù.

> Bad marketing can kill a great company faster than a bad product.

## Interms of work, what are you most passionate about?

I am fueled by his passion for understanding the nuances of the relation of product and promotion **to create amazing solutions to everyday problems**.

I considers myself a "forever student üß†," eager to both build on my academic foundations in the science of information technology but also psychology and sociology, and staying in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued involvement and professional development.

## What do you consider some of your biggest professional and personal acomplishments?

My hunger for knowledge and determination to **turn information into action** has contributed to building a space where every day I shares my learnings on various platforms including here, YouTube channel, and social media platforms üßëüèª‚Äçüíª. This journey has taught me a lot about product development, promotion and branding.

Meanwhile, I have vastly **improved the client converstion systems** of most of my clients by implementing strategic marketing methods, modern tools and reducing the overall cost to acquire customers. I believe that for companies with great products, _predictable systems_ are the key to explosive scale ‚ö°.

## What are you looking for right now?

Aside from my online presence where I shares about my learnings, I am currently **_helping businesses improve their client numbers by building high-converting sales & marketing systems_** & running Sitestack, the first all-in-one solution for African SMBs and e-commerce brands to manage their complete sales & marketing operation.
